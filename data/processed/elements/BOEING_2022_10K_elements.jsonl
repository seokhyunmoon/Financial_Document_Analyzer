Historically, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog.

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a type certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircraft’s flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were submitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737 7 and 737 10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting specifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737 10, any new 737 MAX aircraft must include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in Boeing’s application for the certification for the 737 10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning three years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737 10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have provisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience delays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs.

A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.

Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates.

Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status.

We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For U.S. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on U.S. Cost Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases.

Approximately 70% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the 737 MAX in 2019 and the associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries in multiple jurisdictions significantly reduced our market share with respect to deliveries of single aisle aircraft and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market share. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100 150 seat transcontinental market. Other competitors are also in different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft, including Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC), which delivered its first C919 aircraft in 2022. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.", "page": 30}

Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, 737 7 and 737 10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. These challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations.

We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2021 and 2020, 20.5% and 29.4% of the western built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.

When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for contracts with the U.S. government.

Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions. From a U.S. federal tax perspective, the Company generated a tax NOL in 2020 that was carried back to prior years when the tax rate was 35% due to the CARES Act benefit as described above.

To measure the valuation allowance, the Company estimated in what year each of its deferred tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to estimate the reversal patterns. Based on these methods, deferred tax liabilities are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next 5 to 10 years while deferred tax assets related to pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are assumed to reverse and generate tax deductions over the next 15 to 20 years.

In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach forward loss of $291 in the third quarter of 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased the MQ 25 reach forward loss by $579 primarily driven by higher than anticipated costs to manufacture the EMD units reflecting recent performance which is resulting in additional factory resources and increased engineering costs to address design and supplier quality issues. We also increased costs associated with engineering design challenges, additional testing and certification activities, and flight test support.

The changes in the asset allocation are reflected in the table below.

Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions.

The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involves estimating the costs to complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Margins on fixed price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. The operational and technical complexities of fixed price development contracts create financial risk, which could increase the estimates of costs and result in lower margins or material reach forward losses.
