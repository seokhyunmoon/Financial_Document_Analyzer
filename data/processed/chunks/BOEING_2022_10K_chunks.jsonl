We are subject to various federal, state, local and non U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We could also be affected by laws and regulations relating to climate change, including laws limiting or otherwise related to greenhouse gas emissions. These laws and regulations could lead to increased environmental compliance expenditures, increased energy and raw materials costs and new and/or additional investment in designs and technologies. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.", "page_start": 6, "page_end": 6, "source_elements": [121, 122, 123, 124]}

The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government to government relations, technological advances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period. We enter into firm fixed price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control.

Our Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specifications, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop and certify new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards. The commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non U.S. suppliers, highly skilled labor performed by thousands of employees of ours and other partners, and stringent and evolving regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a type certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircraft’s flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were submitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737 7 and 737 10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting specifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737 10, any new 737 MAX aircraft must include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in Boeing’s application for the certification for the 737 10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning three years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737 10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have provisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience delays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737 7 and 737 10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, certification and production schedules.", "page_start": 8, "page_end": 9, "source_elements": [152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157]}

A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane deliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023. Production of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023. The 737 program has experienced operational and supply chain challenges stabilizing production at 31 per month.

Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. Incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Customer and supplier claims and assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating revenues, costs and profit rates. Estimates of future award fees are also included in revenues and profit rates. With respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. Several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. In addition, on development programs such as the 777X, 737 7 and 737 10 we are subject to risks with respect to the timing and conditions of aircraft certification, including potential gaps between when aircraft are certified in various jurisdictions, changes in certification processes and our estimates with respect to timing of future certifications, which could have an impact on overall program status.

While fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. If our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2022, BDS recorded additional losses on several fixed price development programs. We continue to experience near term production disruptions and inefficiencies due to supplier disruption, labor instability and factory performance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on a number of fixed price development programs which are expected to adversely affect cash flows in future periods, and may result in future earnings charges and adverse cash flow effects. New programs could also have risk for reach forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed price contracts inherently risky. Fixed price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance, which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance. Estimating costs to complete fixed price development contracts is generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed price production contracts. Many of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.

The pace of the commercial market recovery remains impacted by government restrictions related to COVID 19, especially China. We are seeing a strong recovery in travel demand for our airline customers in North and South America, the Middle East, and Europe, and demand for dedicated freighters continues to be underpinned by a strong recovery in global trade. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID 19, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Airline financial performance, which influences demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID 19 pandemic. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net losses for the airline industry were $138 billion in 2020 and $42 billion in 2021. IATA also forecasts $6.9 billion of losses for the industry globally in 2022, with approximately $9.9 billion of profits in North America driven by the robust domestic market being more than offset by losses in other regions. For 2023, IATA is forecasting $4.6 billion in profits for the industry globally. While the outlook continues to improve, we continue to face a challenging environment in the near to medium term as airlines are facing increased fuel and other costs, and the global economy is experiencing high inflation. The current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines. 20 Table of Contents The long term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 3.8% growth rate for passenger and cargo traffic over a 20 year period. Based on long term global economic growth projections of 2.6% in average annual gross domestic product, we project demand for approximately 41,170 new airplanes over the next 20 years.

We expect BGS commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry continues to recover. The demand outlook for our government services business remains stable.

Outside of the U.S., we are seeing similar solid demand as governments prioritize security, defense technology and global cooperation given evolving threats. We continue to experience near term production disruptions and inefficiencies due to supplier disruption, labor instability and factory performance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on a number of fixed price development programs which are expected to adversely affect cash flows in future periods. As a result of the war in Ukraine, we recorded earnings charges totaling $212 million during the first quarter of 2022, primarily related to asset impairments. We have closed our facilities in Russia. We are focused on the safety of our employees and retaining the strength of our engineering talent through voluntary transfers to other countries. We have also suspended our business in Russia, including parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines, and purchases from Russian suppliers. We are complying with U.S. and international sanctions and export control restrictions. We have sufficient material and parts to avoid production disruptions in the near term, but future impacts to our production from disruptions in our supply chain are possible.

Industry Competitiveness The industry continues to recover from the lingering effects of the COVID 19 pandemic. The commercial aircraft market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts and responses have varied globally, the reduction of demand and disruption in production has adversely impacted most manufacturers in the commercial aircraft industry. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns. Approximately 70% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the 737 MAX in 2019 and the associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries in multiple jurisdictions significantly reduced our market share with respect to deliveries of single aisle aircraft and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market share. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100 150 seat transcontinental market. Other competitors are also in different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft, including Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC), which delivered its first C919 aircraft in 2022. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.", "page_start": 30, "page_end": 30, "source_elements": [417, 418, 419]}

Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737 10, any new 737 MAX aircraft must include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in Boeing’s application for the certification for the 737 10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning three years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737 10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancements.

Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through December 31, 2022 totaled $1.7 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2022 we adjusted the total estimate of abnormal production costs up to $2.8 billion with most being incurred by the end of 2023. At December 31, 2021, we were expecting to incur approximately $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis. The increase was primarily driven by a decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 to slow down near term production due to supply chain constraints and increased inspection and rework costs.

The increase in Accrued liabilities is primarily driven by the accrued losses on BDS fixed price development programs, lower payments to 737 MAX customers in 2022, and a $0.7 billion 40 Table of Contents payment in 2021 consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Concessions paid to 737 MAX customers totaled $1.0 billion and $2.5 billion during 2022 and 2021. Growth in Accounts Payable in 2022 is a source of cash while reductions in Accounts Payable in 2021 were a use of cash generally reflecting increases in production rates. Inventory improvements were driven by higher 737 MAX deliveries and resumption of 787 deliveries in 2022. Additionally, in 2022 and 2021 we received income tax refunds of $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.1 billion in 2022, as compared with $2.5 billion of cash provided in 2021. The $3.4 billion reduction in non cash items in 2022 is primarily driven by the $3.5 billion reach forward loss on the 787 program that was recorded in 2021. Net loss for 2022 was $5.1 billion compared with net loss of $4.3 billion in 2021. The $0.8 billion year over year increase in the net loss is primarily driven by the absence of an income tax benefit in 2022. The reduction in cash used by operating activities in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by lower net loss and improved changes in assets and liabilities. Non cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as a reduction to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share based", "page_start": 42, "page_end": 43, "source_elements": [592, 593, 594, 595, 596]}

Our long term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. Accounting for long term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index based clauses). The majority of these long term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and lingering impacts of COVID 19. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach forward loss or an adjustment to a reach forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. Net cumulative catch up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long term contracts, including the impact of increases in estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $5,253 million, $880 million and $942 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cumulative catch up adjustments in 2022 were primarily due to losses recognized on the VC 25B, KC 46A Tanker, MQ 25, Commercial Crew and T 7A Red Hawk programs. These are all fixed price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.", "page_start": 50, "page_end": 50, "source_elements": [687, 688, 689, 690]}

A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long term production effort for 48 Table of Contents delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, learning curve, change incorporation, regulatory requirements in connection with certification, flight test and certification schedules, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary or deflationary trends, and lingering impacts of COVID 19. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.", "page_start": 50, "page_end": 51, "source_elements": [693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 698]}

The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach forward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material. 787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the 787 program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased the 787 program accounting quantity by 100 units due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program’s profit margin. Our program revenue and cost assumptions reflect our current best estimate.

The Company had deferred income tax liabilities of $9,306 million at December 31, 2022 that will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. On a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. This assessment takes into account both positive and negative evidence. A recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. Due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not include future projected earnings in our analysis. Rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods. Deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the next five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significant deductible amounts beyond five years. The Company’s valuation allowance of $3,162 million at December 31, 2022 primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets, tax credits and other carryforwards that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur.

For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. Revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales. Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit upon order and additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not considered a significant financing component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. Long term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurity products, surveillance suites, advanced weapons, missile defense, military derivative aircraft, satellite systems and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighters. Sales of services under long term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew. 59 Table of Contents For each long term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone selling prices. A long term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long term contracts may be modified over their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long term contracts include in the transaction price variable consideration, such as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.", "page_start": 63, "page_end": 64, "source_elements": [965, 966, 967, 968, 969, 970, 971]}

We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. Similarly, for non U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not have an alternative use to the Company. The accounting for long term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing revenue as costs are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer. For long term contracts for which revenue is recognized over time, changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long term contract’s percentage of completion. When the current estimates of total revenues and costs at completion for a long term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach forward loss on the long term contract is recognized. The table below reflects the impact of net cumulative catch up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long term contracts including the impact to Loss from operations from increases in estimated losses on unexercised options for the years ended December 31:", "page_start": 64, "page_end": 64, "source_elements": [972, 973, 974, 975]}

Payments under long term contracts may be received before or after revenue is recognized. The U.S. government customer typically withholds payment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion. Therefore, long term contracts typically generate Unbilled receivables (contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances and progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company in the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed. Commercial spare parts contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment include sales of commercial spare parts. For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair value. We generally consider each spare part to be a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare part where a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination of these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.", "page_start": 64, "page_end": 65, "source_elements": [977, 978, 979, 980, 981, 982]}

We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the services are rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred. Concession sharing arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products. Unbilled receivables and advances and progress billings Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the contract with the customer. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise when the Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract. Financial services revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales type/finance leases, operating leases and loans in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales type leases, we recognize selling profit or loss at lease inception if collection of the lease payments is probable. For sales type and direct finance leases, we record customer financing receivables at lease inception. A customer financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and any deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. For notes receivable, we record customer financing receivables net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.", "page_start": 65, "page_end": 65, "source_elements": [983, 984, 985, 986]}

We determine that a customer financing receivable is uncollectible when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. We determine a customer financing receivable is past due when cash has not been received upon the due date specified in the contract. We evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. If a customer financing receivable is determined to be uncollectible, the customer is categorized as non accrual status. When a customer is in non accrual status at commencement, sales type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non accrual status. If we have a direct finance lease and/or a note receivable with a customer that is in non accrual status, or a sales type lease with a customer that changes to non accrual status after commencement, we recognize contractual interest income as payments are received to the extent there is sufficient collateral and payments exceed past due principal payments. Residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur. For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Customer financing, net, are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We evaluate for impairment assets under operating leases when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value.

The adequacy of these allowances is assessed quarterly through consideration of factors such as customer credit ratings, bankruptcy filings, published or estimated credit default rates, age of the receivable, expected loss rates and collateral exposures. Collateral exposure is the excess of the carrying value of a financial asset over the fair value of the related collateral. We determine the creditworthiness of our customers by assigning internal credit ratings based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from the customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by major credit rating agencies. Customer financing receivables are collateralized by security in the related asset. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft collateral. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall.", "page_start": 72, "page_end": 72, "source_elements": [1056, 1057, 1058]}

Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities. The fair value of trade in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements; or the scrap market. Trade in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions. 68 Table of Contents", "page_start": 72, "page_end": 73, "source_elements": [1060, 1061, 1062, 1063, 1064, 1065, 1066]}

These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense.

These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate. We provide guarantees to certain commercial aircraft customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets.

In the fourth quarter of 2020 and throughout 2021 and 2022, the Company was in a three year cumulative pre tax loss position. We also normalized earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) for certain non recurring items and reached a normalized three year cumulative loss position in 2021. Adjustments to normalize earnings included non recurring items for certain 737 MAX expenses, an agreement with the Department of Justice, severance costs and remeasurement gains and losses from the annual remeasurement of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company determined that it could not include future projected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recorded valuation allowances of $3,162 and $2,423 primarily for certain federal deferred tax assets, as well as for certain federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. To measure the valuation allowance, the Company estimated in what year each of its deferred tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to estimate the reversal patterns. Based on these methods, deferred tax liabilities are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next 5 to 10 years while deferred tax assets related to pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are assumed to reverse and generate tax deductions over the next 15 to 20 years. The valuation allowance primarily results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversals in the appropriate future periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets.", "page_start": 78, "page_end": 78, "source_elements": [1183, 1184, 1185]}

This reflects a tax expense of $1,199 recorded in continuing operations and an increase of $18 related to the associated federal benefit of state impacts. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of $478 included in OCI primarily due to the net actuarial gains that resulted from the annual remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities. Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or OCI. 74 Table of Contents The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) one time repatriation tax and Global Intangible Low Tax Income liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes.

Specific investment objectives for our long term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified. We periodically update our long term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of our strategy is to de risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2022, the funded status of the plans increased as compared to 2021, and additional assets were reallocated to fixed income. The changes in the asset allocation are reflected in the table below. We identify investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short term investments and exchange traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced frequently.

See page 58 for the Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. BCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Revenue on commercial aircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer. BDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmanned military aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space exploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred. BGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information based services to commercial and government customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue on commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other contracts is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our customers. 109 Table of Contents While our principal operations are in the United States, Canada and Australia, some key suppliers and subcontractors are located in Europe and Japan.

The process of estimating margin at completion involves estimating the costs to complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Margins on fixed price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. The operational and technical complexities of fixed price development contracts create financial risk, which could increase the estimates of costs and result in lower margins or material reach forward losses. The ongoing effects of macroeconomic challenges, including supply chain disruption, labor shortages, and inflationary pressures compound these complexities and related financial risks. Given the complexities of certain of the Company’s fixed price development contracts, including the KC 46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, United States Air Force VC 25B Presidential Aircraft, T 7A Redhawk, and MQ 25 contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC 46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, United States Air Force VC 25B Presidential Aircraft, T 7A Redhawk, and MQ 25 fixed price development contracts included the following, among others: We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its estimates.", "page_start": 120, "page_end": 120, "source_elements": [1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973]}

Plan History The Plan (originally named, the Supplemental Benefit Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company) (the “Plan”) was originally established effective January 1, 1978, by The Boeing Company. The Plan has been amended and restated from time to time since its original effective date, including on January 1, 2008, to comply with Code section 409A. As of January 1, 2022, the Plan was amended and restated to (A) reflect the merger of the Deferred Compensation Plan for Employees of The Boeing Company with and into the Plan, (B) eliminate Restoration SSP+ Company Contributions and Executive SSP+ Company Contributions, (C) add a new Restoration True Up Contribution, Incentive Matching Contribution and Company Non Elective Contribution, (D) simplify the mid year enrollment provisions in the Participant Deferral component of the Plan, and (E) make certain other changes. Effective January 1, 2022 (or as otherwise stated herein), the Plan is now again amended and restated to (i) incorporate Amendments 1 and 2 to the January 1, 2022 restatement dated December 10, 2021, (ii) reflect the March enrollment window for Cash Incentive Deferrals, and (iii) clarify or update certain definitions and administrative aspects of the Plan.", "page_start": 142, "page_end": 142, "source_elements": [2261, 2262, 2263, 2264, 2265, 2266, 2267, 2268, 2269, 2270]}

To the extent any part of the Plan is not an excess benefit plan, it is intended that the Plan is an unfunded plan maintained primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees under sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. 2", "page_start": 142, "page_end": 143, "source_elements": [2271, 2272, 2273, 2274]}
