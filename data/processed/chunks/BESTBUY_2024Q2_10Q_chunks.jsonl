All adjustments were comprised of normal recurring adjustments, except as noted in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire fiscal year. The interim financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023. The first six months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 included 26 weeks. In preparing the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we evaluated the period from July 29, 2023, through the date the financial statements were issued for material subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure. No such events were identified. Sale of Subsidiary In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed the sale of a Mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in Mexico and recognized a $21 million gain within Gain on sale of subsidiary, net on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023.

We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business. The International segment is comprised of all our operations in Canada. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. Comparable Sales Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. Comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations, the impact of profit share revenue from our services plan portfolio and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only).

We believe that non GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide additional useful information for evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts and financial targets used for short term incentives are based on non GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, price fixing settlements, gains and losses on sales of subsidiaries and certain investments, intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non GAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. We provide reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non GAAP financial measures that enable investors to understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non GAAP financial measures and to evaluate performance using the same metrics as management. These non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes. In our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency exchange rates we use to convert the International segment’s operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use the term “constant currency,” which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impacts as the difference between the current period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We believe the disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.", "page_start": 15, "page_end": 15, "source_elements": [402, 403]}

We continue to appropriately balance the need to adjust in response to current industry sales trends with the need to invest so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to expected growth. Our digital sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and nearly twice as high as the percentage of Domestic revenue in the pre pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020. During these same time periods, the percentage of online sales picked up in our stores by our customers was also consistent at just over 40%. Therefore, we are continuing to adapt our omni channel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. We believe our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver our fiscal 2024 store plans, which include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 large format Experience store remodels and expanding the number of Outlet stores to approximately 25 by the end of fiscal 2024. We continue to advance our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our industry and marketplace trends with two overarching goals in mind efficiently allocating our labor cost, considering the channel shift from our physical stores to online, and providing our employees flexibility, predictability and opportunities to gain more skills.

Our effective tax rate (“ETR”) increased to 26.1% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 15.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters.

Our ETR increased to 24.8% in the first six months of fiscal 2024 compared to 20.5% in the first six months of fiscal 2023, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax benefits from stock based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre tax earnings. Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual ETR, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. We update our estimate of the annual ETR each quarter and we make a cumulative adjustment if our estimated tax rate changes. Our quarterly tax provision and our quarterly estimate of our annual ETR are subject to variation due to several factors, including our ability to accurately forecast our pre tax and taxable income and loss by jurisdiction, tax audit developments, recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies related to stock based compensation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in laws or regulations, and expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Our ETR can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre tax earnings. For example, the impact of discrete items and non deductible losses on our ETR is greater when our pre tax earnings are lower. 16 Table of Contents", "page_start": 16, "page_end": 17, "source_elements": [439, 440, 441, 442, 443]}

Among the factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in such forward looking statements are the following: macroeconomic pressures in the markets in which we operate (including but not limited to recession, inflation rates, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, limitations on a government’s ability to borrow and/or spend capital, fluctuations in housing prices, energy markets, and jobless rates and effects related to the conflict in Ukraine or other geopolitical events); catastrophic events, health crises and pandemics; susceptibility of the products we sell to technological advancements, product life cycle fluctuations and; changes in consumer preferences; competition (including from multi channel retailers, e commerce business, technology service providers, traditional store based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers and in the provision of delivery speed and options); our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; changes in market compensation rates; our expansion into health and new products, services and technologies; our focus on services as a strategic priority; our reliance on key vendors and mobile network carriers (including product availability); our ability to maintain positive brand perception and recognition; our ability to effectively manage strategic ventures, alliances or acquisitions; our ability to effectively manage our real estate portfolio; inability of vendors or service providers to perform components of our supply chain (impacting our stores or other aspects of our operations) and other various functions of our business; risks arising from and potentially unique to our exclusive brands products; our reliance on our information technology systems, internet and telecommunications access and capabilities; our ability to prevent or effectively respond to a cyber attack, privacy or security breach; product safety and quality concerns; changes to labor or employment laws or regulations; risks arising from statutory, regulatory and legal developments (including statutes and/or regulations related to tax or privacy); evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations (including, but not limited to, cybersecurity and environmental, social and governance matters) risks arising from our international activities (including those related to the conflict in Ukraine or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates) and those of our vendors; failure to effectively manage our costs; our dependence on cash flows and net earnings generated during the fourth fiscal quarter; pricing investments and promotional activity; economic or regulatory developments that might affect our ability to provide attractive promotional financing; constraints in the capital markets; changes to our vendor credit terms; changes in our credit ratings; failure to meet financial performance guidance or other forward looking statements; and general economic uncertainty in key global markets and worsening of global economic conditions or low levels of economic growth. We caution that the foregoing list of important factors is not complete. Any forward looking statements speak only as", "page_start": 23, "page_end": 23, "source_elements": [631]}

We estimate that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations had an unfavorable impact on our revenue of approximately $26 million and $72 million in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, respectively.
