(A) NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES \"Adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income,\" \"adjusted net earnings from continuing operations,\" \"adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations,\" and \"adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations\" are non GAAP financial measures and should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. The Company provides earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, net earnings from continuing operations, net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and effective tax rate from continuing operations on an adjusted basis because management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors. Among other things, these measures may assist investors in evaluating the Company's results of operations period over period. In various periods, these measures may exclude such items as intangible asset amortization expense, significant gains from divestitures, significant costs associated with acquisitions, restructuring, litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters). Special items may be highly variable, difficult to predict, and of a size that sometimes has substantial impact on the Company's reported results of operations for a period. Management uses these measures internally for planning, forecasting and evaluating the performances of the Company's businesses, including allocating resources and evaluating results relative to employee performance compensation targets. Unlike earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, net earnings from continuing operations, net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and effective tax rate from continuing operations prepared in accordance with GAAP, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before provision for taxes on income, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations, adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) from continuing operations, and adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other companies. The limitations of using these non GAAP financial measures as performance measures are that they provide a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period, such as intangible asset amortization expense, significant gains from divestitures, the effects of an acquisition, restructuring, litigation, and changes in applicable laws and regulations (including significant accounting or tax matters) and do not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to other companies in the health care industry.

Investors should consider non GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Due to the variable nature of acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact they may have on the analysis of underlying business performance and trends, management believes that providing this measure enhances an investor’s understanding of the Company’s performance and may assist in the evaluation of ongoing business operations period over period. This non GAAP financial measure is presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses the performance of the Company, including for internal evaluation of the performance of the Company's businesses and planning and forecasting for future periods. The use of this non GAAP financial measure as a performance measure is limited in that it provides a view of the Company's results of operations without including all events during a period and may not provide a comparable view of the Company's performance to that of other companies in the health care industry.", "page_start": 18, "page_end": 18, "source_elements": [301, 302]}
