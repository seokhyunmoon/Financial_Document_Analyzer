Throughout 2022, we launched Amex Flex across our offices, where, depending on role and business needs, colleagues can work in the office, at home or take a hybrid approach that combines both.

We continue to appropriately balance the need to adjust in response to current industry sales trends with the need to invest so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to expected growth. Our digital sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and nearly twice as high as the percentage of Domestic revenue in the pre pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020. During these same time periods, the percentage of online sales picked up in our stores by our customers was also consistent at just over 40%. Therefore, we are continuing to adapt our omni channel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. We believe our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver our fiscal 2024 store plans, which include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 large format Experience store remodels and expanding the number of Outlet stores to approximately 25 by the end of fiscal 2024. We continue to advance our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our industry and marketplace trends with two overarching goals in mind efficiently allocating our labor cost, considering the channel shift from our physical stores to online, and providing our employees flexibility, predictability and opportunities to gain more skills. We are focused on balancing the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our customers and other stakeholders. At the same time, we have been investing in tools, training and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. As not all roles, and the associated hourly pay, are the same, we are making the strategic tradeoff decisions necessary to give us the ability to flexibly adjust our labor spending appropriately, particularly customer facing labor."}, {"chunk_id": "214", "source_doc": "BESTBUY_2024Q2_10Q", "doc_id": "BESTBUY_2024Q2_10Q_p25", "type": "text", "page_start": 25, "page_end": 25, "text": "Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 3.1 to the Current Report on Form 8 K filed by Best Buy Co., Inc. on June 12, 2020). 3.1 3.2 Amended and Restated By Laws (incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit 3.1 to the Current Report on Form 8 K filed by Best Buy Co., Inc. on June 14, 2018).

Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening.

In 2022, we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus, including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains, up to 2 million acres; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability, new substrates, and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils; and a joint effort with a start up called N Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water saving, crop enhancing benefits to farmers around the world."}], "hits": [{"chunk_id": "352", "source_doc": "PEPSICO_2022_10K", "doc_id": "PEPSICO_2022_10K_p65", "type": "text", "page_start": 65, "page_end": 65, "text": "PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 (in millions)"}, {"chunk_id": "356", "source_doc": "PEPSICO_2022_10K", "doc_id": "PEPSICO_2022_10K_p66", "type": "text", "page_start": 66, "page_end": 66, "text": "PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 (in millions except per share amounts)"}, {"chunk_id": "1571", "source_doc": "PEPSICO_2022_10K", "doc_id": "PEPSICO_2022_10K_p482", "type": "title", "page_start": 482, "page_end": 482, "text": "PEPSICO, INC.
