<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The key agenda of AMCOR&#x27;s 8K filing dated July 1, 2022, was to disclose the execution of two supplemental indentures on June 30, 2022, involving Amcor Finance (USA), Inc.

For additional information regarding the nature of charges discussed below, refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, Note 2, Restructuring, and Note 3, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Notes to 
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
(1)
Represents the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology assets.
(2)
Represents charges related to employee termination benefits and subsequent adjustments from higher-than-expected employee retention related to previously planned organizational changes.
(3)
Represents the gain on sale of a Mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in Mexico.
(4)
The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S. and Mexico. As such, the forecasted annual income tax charge on the U.S. non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 
24.5%. There is no forecasted annual income tax benefit for Mexico non-GAAP items, as there is no forecasted annual tax expense on the income in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.
 
Our non-GAAP operating income rates decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to unfavorable SG&amp;A rates, partially 
offset by favorable gross profit rates.
 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Our non-
GAAP effective tax rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax 
benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.
 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the decreases in non-GAAP operating income.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support 
our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital 
management. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share 
repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other 
changes in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Boeing&#x27;s business is subject to cyclicality, particularly in its Commercial Airplanes segment, which is influenced by economic conditions affecting demand for air travel and business aviation. The company&#x27;s reliance on U.S. government contracts [3] introduces some stability, but its commercial aviation operations are more cyclical, tied to market demand and economic cycles. Additionally, external disruptions like pandemics or geopolitical tensions [2, 5] can further impact performance, though these factors are not strictly cyclical in nature.</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Boeing did not report any materially important ongoing legal battles specifically related to FY2022 in the provided sources. However, the company referenced an existing Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice, which was consistent with payments made in 2021 [1]. This DPA, while an ongoing legal matter from prior years, is not explicitly stated as a new or materially significant issue in FY2022.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Boeing&#x27;s gross margin profile is not directly reported in the sources, but the 777X program&#x27;s gross margins were near break-even in FY2022 [1]. This suggests potential improvement in specific programs. However, the overall operating margins (which are distinct from gross margins) improved from -22.0% in FY2020 to -5.3% in FY2022 [2]. Gross margin may not be a useful metric for Boeing due to its reliance on program accounting, which involves estimating gross profit margins for long-term contracts with uncertain costs and revenues [3, 4].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model denies a directly reported improving gross margin, contradicting the ground truth that Boeing’s gross margin rose from 4.8% to 5.3% in FY2022, thus providing an inaccurate answer.</div></div>

Net loss for 2022 was $5.1 billion compared with net loss of $4.3 billion in 2021. The $0.8 billion year over year increase in the net loss is primarily driven by the absence of an income tax benefit in 2022. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p55)</span><span class="hit-body"> | Years ended December 31, | 2022 | 2021 | 202( | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Sales of products | $55,893 | $51,386 | $47,142 | | Sales of services | 10,715 | 10,900 | 11,016 | | Total revenues | 66,608 | 62,286 | 58,158 | | Sost of products | (53,969\) | (49,954\) | (54,568 | | Dost of services | (9,109\) | (9,283\) | (9,232 | | 30eing Capital interest expense | (28\) | (32\) | (43 | | Total costs and expenses | (63,106\) | (59,269\) | (63,843 | |  | 3,502 | 3,017 | (5,685 | | Loss)/income from operating investments, net | (16\) | 210 | 9 | | 3eneral and administrative expense | (4,187\) | (4,157\) | (4,817 | | Research and development expense, net | (2,852\) | (2,249\) | (2,476 | | Sain on dispositions, net | 6 | 277 | 202 | | \_oss from operations | (3,547\) | (2,902\) | (12,767 | | Dither income, net | 1,058 | 551 | 447 | | nterest and debt expense | (2,533\) | (2,682\) | (2,156 | | \_oss before income taxes | (5,022\) | (5,033\) | (14,476 | | ncome tax (expense)/benefit | (31\) | 743 | 2,535 | | Net loss | (5,053\) | (4,290\) | (11,941 | | \_ess: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest | (118\) | (88\) | (68 | | Net loss attributable to Boeing Shareholders | ($4,935\) | ($4,202\) | ($11,873 | | 3asic loss per share | ($8\.30\) | ($7\.15\) | ($20\.88 | | Diluted loss per share | ($8\.30\) | ($7\.15\) | ($20\.88 | </span></li></ol></div>

2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new
technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and
information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our
manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth
quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within
the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash
expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and
other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35%
for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [novel-generated]</h3><div class="text">Did Ulta Beauty&#x27;s wages expense as a percent of net sales increase or decrease in FY2023?</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Wages expense as a percent of net sales increased in FY2023. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The necessary information about Ulta Beauty&#x27;s wages expense as a percent of net sales for FY2023 is not provided in the available sources. None of the cited chunks include data on wages expense or its relationship to net sales [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model incorrectly states that wages‑expense data is unavailable, while the ground truth confirms it increased in FY2023.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p1):</strong> For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022
Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&amp;A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to
23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of
incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate
overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits
due to wage investments.</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [domain-relevant]</h3><div class="text">Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Performance is not measured through operating margin</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The sources do not provide sufficient data to determine whether AMEX&#x27;s operating margin improved in 2022. While operating expenses increased 24% year over year [1], and net income declined from $8.1 billion to $7.5 billion [2], these metrics do not directly reflect operating margin (which requires operating income/revenue). No explicit operating income or revenue figures are provided for 2022 to calculate the margin. Operating margin may still be a useful metric, but the lack of granular financial data limits analysis [1, 2].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model correctly notes insufficient data to calculate operating margin but fails to state the key Ground Truth point that AMEX does not measure performance by operating margin, leaving the answer incomplete.</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [novel-generated]</h3><div class="text">What drove the reduction in SG&amp;A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023?</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The reduction in SG&amp;A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023 was driven by lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, as observed in FY2022 [1]. However, the sources do not explicitly state the reasons for the FY2023 reduction, relying on prior-year factors as context.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model correctly identifies lower marketing expenses and incentive compensation as the drivers, but omits the key context that FY2023 refers to the 12‑month period ending Jan 28, 2023 (fiscal 2022) as noted in the ground truth.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p1):</strong> For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022
Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&amp;A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to
23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of
incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate
overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits
due to wage investments.</div></div>
