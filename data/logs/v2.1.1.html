For additional information regarding the nature of charges discussed below, refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, Note 2, Restructuring, and Note 3, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Notes to 
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
(1)
Represents the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology assets.
(2)
Represents charges related to employee termination benefits and subsequent adjustments from higher-than-expected employee retention related to previously planned organizational changes.
(3)
Represents the gain on sale of a Mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in Mexico.
(4)
The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S. and Mexico. As such, the forecasted annual income tax charge on the U.S. non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 
24.5%. There is no forecasted annual income tax benefit for Mexico non-GAAP items, as there is no forecasted annual tax expense on the income in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.
 
Our non-GAAP operating income rates decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to unfavorable SG&amp;A rates, partially 
offset by favorable gross profit rates.
 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Our non-
GAAP effective tax rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax 
benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.
 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the decreases in non-GAAP operating income.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support 
our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital 
management. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share 
repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other 
changes in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.

Additionally, in 2022 and 2021 we received income tax refunds of $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.1 billion in 2022, as compared with $2.5 billion of cash provided in 2021. The $3.4 billion reduction in non-cash items in 2022 is primarily driven by the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program that was recorded in 2021. Net loss for 2022 was $5.1 billion compared with net loss of $4.3 billion in 2021. The $0.8 billion year-over-year increase in the net loss is primarily driven by the absence of an income tax benefit in 2022. The reduction in cash used by operating activities in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by lower net loss and improved changes in assets and liabilities. Non-cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as a reduction to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share-based </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p124)</span><span class="hit-body"> We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

We continue to work with a small number of customers who have requested to defer deliveries or to cancel orders for 737 MAX aircraft, and we are remarketing and/or delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. We have approximately 250 aircraft in inventory as of December 31, 2022, including approximately 140 aircraft in inventory that are designated for customers in China. We are remarketing some of these aircraft to other customers. We anticipate delivering most of the aircraft in inventory by the end of 2024. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in China or remarket those aircraft and/or ramp up deliveries consistent with our assumptions, our expectation of delivery timing could be impacted. 31</li></ul></div>

The enacted FY23 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, including the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, and the Space Launch System. The FY23 appropriations support F/A-18 production further into calendar year 2025. The FY23 appropriations did not include funding for additional P-8 aircraft. The P-8 program continues to pursue additional sales opportunities to extend production beyond 2024. There is ongoing uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD, NASA and other government agencies for fiscal year 2024 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to continue to be subject to pressure. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows. Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2022, 28% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p9)</span><span class="hit-body"> In addition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787 aircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane deliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft. We must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to meet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023. Production of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023. The 737 program has experienced operational and supply chain challenges stabilizing production at 31 per month. We plan to gradually increase 737 production rates based on market demand and supply chain capacity. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory.

We increased the production rate to 31 per month in 2022, and expect to implement further gradual production rate increases based on market demand and supply chain capacity. We expensed abnormal production costs of $188 million and $1,887 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Over 190 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations.

A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is composed of customers that have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft. BCC provided customer financing of $96 million during 2022 and none during 2021. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2023 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 4,950 western- built commercial jet aircraft (18.3% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2022, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, a larger portion are expected to be retired compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, which directly impacts the Company in terms of number of new aircraft deliveries and financing opportunities, the ability of existing customers to meet current payment obligations and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2021 and 2020, 20.5% and 29.4% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.

Ending production of the 747 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 24 units during 2022 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. The commercial program has near break-even gross margins. We are currently producing at a combined rate of 3 aircraft per month. 777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 40 units during 2022 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a combined production rate of 3 per month for the 777/777X programs. The accounting quantity for the 777X program increased by 50 units during 2022 reflecting the launch of the 777X-8 freighter during the first quarter of 2022. First delivery of the 777X-8 freighter is expected in 2027. During the first quarter of 2022, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X-9, previously expected in late 2023, and now expect it will occur in 2025, based on an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements. We are working towards Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification will ultimately be determined by the regulators, and further determinations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p43)</span><span class="hit-body"> payment in 2021 consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Concessions paid to 737 MAX customers totaled $1.0 billion and $2.5 billion during 2022 and 2021. Growth in Accounts Payable in 2022 is a source of cash while reductions in Accounts Payable in 2021 were a use of cash generally reflecting increases in production rates. Inventory improvements were driven by higher 737 MAX deliveries and resumption of 787 deliveries in 2022. Additionally, in 2022 and 2021 we received income tax refunds of $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.1 billion in 2022, as compared with $2.5 billion of cash provided in 2021. The $3.4 billion reduction in non-cash items in 2022 is primarily driven by the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program that was recorded in 2021. Net loss for 2022 was $5.1 billion compared with net loss of $4.3 billion in 2021. The $0.8 billion year-over-year increase in the net loss is primarily driven by the absence of an income tax benefit in 2022. The reduction in cash used by operating activities in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by lower net loss and improved changes in assets and liabilities. Non-cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as a reduction to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share-based </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p2)</span><span class="hit-body"> Item 1.

2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new
technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and
information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our
manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth
quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within
the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash
expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and
other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35%
for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

Our 2022 annual company scorecard included talent retention, colleague engagement and diversity representation goals. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 53.7 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 18.7 percent, 17.9 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2022 U.S. EEO-1 submission. As of December 31, 2022, 52 percent of our Executive Committee were women or from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds (based on self-identified characteristics). We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and regardless of race and ethnicity in the United States. These reviews consider several factors known to affect compensation, including role, level, tenure, performance and geography. In the instances where a review has found inconsistencies, we have made adjustments. After making these adjustments, we believe we maintained 100 percent pay equity in 2022 for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States. 6 </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p41)</span><span class="hit-body"> Year-end Data American Express S&P 500 Index S&P Financial Index 38 2022 159.71 156.77 136.11 </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p150)</span><span class="hit-body"> CET 1 CET 1 capital Tier 1 capital Total capital (Millions, except percentages) capital Tier 1 capital Total capital ratio ratio ratio December 31, 2022: (a) American Express Company $ 20,030 $ 21,627 $ 24,926 10.3 % 11.1 % 12.8 % American Express National Bank $ 14,820 $ 14,820 $ 17,273 11.3 % 11.3 % 13.2 % December 31, 2021: (a) American Express Company $ 17,554 $ 19,186 $ 21,506 10.5 % 11.5 % 12.9 % American Express National Bank $ 13,085 $ 13,085 $ 15,283 11.8 % 11.8 % 13.7 % Well-capitalized ratios (b) American Express Company N/A 6.0 % 10.0 % American Express National Bank 6.5 % 8.0 % 10.0 % Minimum capital ratios (c) 4.5 % 6.0 % 8.0 % Effective Minimum (d) American Express Company 7.0 % 8.5 % 10.5 % American Express National Bank 7.0 % 8.5 % 10.5 % </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p65)</span><span class="hit-body"> Effective Minimum (a) Risk-Based Capital Common Equity Tier 1 7.0 % American Express Company American Express National Bank 11.3 Tier 1 8.5 American Express Company 11.1 American Express National Bank 11.3 Total 10.5 American Express Company 12.8 American Express National Bank 13.2 Tier 1 Leverage 4.0 % American Express Company 9.9 American Express National Bank </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p146)</span><span class="hit-body"> 2022 2021 U.S. statutory federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % (Decrease) increase in taxes resulting from: Tax credits and tax-exempt income (a) (0.9) (0.1) State and local income taxes, net of federal benefit 3.1 3.0 Non-U.S. subsidiaries' earnings (0.1) 1.1 Tax settlements and lapse of statute of limitations (2.1) (0.3) Valuation allowances (0.1) — Other 0.7 (0.1) Actual tax rates 21.6 % 24.6 % (4.1) 3.7 2.4 (1.6) 4.0 1.6 </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p99)</span><span class="hit-body"> $ Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Provisions for credit losses Depreciation and amortization Stock-based compensation Deferred taxes Other items (a) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and dispositions: Other assets Accounts payable & other liabilities Maturities and redemptions of investment securities Net (increase) decrease in Card Member loans and receivables, and other loans Purchase of premises and equipment, net of sales: 2022, $1; 2021, $88; 2020, $1 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities Net (decrease) increase in short-term borrowings Issuance of American Express preferred shares Redemption of American Express preferred shares Repurchase of American Express common shares and other Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 2022 7,514 2,182 1,626 375 (1,189) 365 (277) 277 1,391 8,815 21,079 26 1,892 (4,175) (29,562) (1,855) (15) — (33,689) 25,902 (706) 23,230 (18,906) — — 56 (3,502) (1,565) 24,509 (13) 11,886 22,028 33,914 $ $ 2021 8,060 (1,419) 1,695 330 294 (772) — — 1,068 5,389 14,645 62 20,032 (1,517) (27,557) (1,550) 1 — (10,529) (2,468) 461 7,788 (11,662) 1,584 (1,600) 64 (7,652) (1,448) (14,933) (120) (10,937) 32,965 22,028 $ $ </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p126)</span><span class="hit-body"> (Millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter American Express Company (Parent Company only) $ 5,750 $ 7,500 $ 5,250 $ 2,450 $ 4,911 $ 4,273 American Express Credit Corporation — — — — 339 — Lending Trust 2,685 2,750 7,250 — — — Other 76 114 67 — — — $ 8,511 $ 10,364 $ 12,567 $ 2,450 $ 5,250 $ 4,273 Unamortized Underwriting Fees Unamortized Discount and Premium Impacts due to Fair Value Hedge Accounting Total Long-Term Debt $ $ $ </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p69)</span><span class="hit-body"> (Billions) American Express Company: American Express Credit Account Master Trust: Total Secured overnight financing rate (SOFR). 66 2022 10.2 1.0 1.2 0.8 7.3 20.5 </span></li></ol></div>

Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions. Because of the revenues generated from having high-spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants. This creates incentives for Card Members to spend more on their cards and positively differentiates American Express cards. We believe our spend-centric model gives us the ability to provide differentiated value to Card Members, merchants and business partners. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p99)</span><span class="hit-body"> $ Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities: Provisions for credit losses Depreciation and amortization Stock-based compensation Deferred taxes Other items (a) Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of effects of acquisitions and dispositions: Other assets Accounts payable & other liabilities Maturities and redemptions of investment securities Net (increase) decrease in Card Member loans and receivables, and other loans Purchase of premises and equipment, net of sales: 2022, $1; 2021, $88; 2020, $1 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities Net (decrease) increase in short-term borrowings Issuance of American Express preferred shares Redemption of American Express preferred shares Repurchase of American Express common shares and other Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities Effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year $ 2022 7,514 2,182 1,626 375 (1,189) 365 (277) 277 1,391 8,815 21,079 26 1,892 (4,175) (29,562) (1,855) (15) — (33,689) 25,902 (706) 23,230 (18,906) — — 56 (3,502) (1,565) 24,509 (13) 11,886 22,028 33,914 $ $ 2021 8,060 (1,419) 1,695 330 294 (772) — — 1,068 5,389 14,645 62 20,032 (1,517) (27,557) (1,550) 1 — (10,529) (2,468) 461 7,788 (11,662) 1,584 (1,600) 64 (7,652) (1,448) (14,933) (120) (10,937) 32,965 22,028 $ $ </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p3)</span><span class="hit-body"> Throughout this report the terms “American Express,” “we,” “our” or “us,” refer to American Express Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, unless stated or the context implies otherwise.

The increase in Membership Rewards expense was also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Business development expense increased, primarily due to increased partner payments and client incentives, both of which were driven by higher network volumes. Card Member services expense increased, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits. Marketing expense increased, primarily due to business investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, reflecting an increase in our colleague base to support business growth as well as compensation decisions made.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The provided sources do not explicitly state whether American Express retained card members during 2022. While the company outlines strategies to retain existing card members [9], there is no direct mention of retention rates, churn metrics, or specific outcomes related to card member retention for 2022.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Citations</h3><ul class="citations"><li><strong>[9]</strong> We seek to grow our business by focusing on four strategic imperatives: First, we aim to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver membership benefits that span our customers’ everyday spending, borrowing, travel and lifestyle needs, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and developing a range of experiences that attract high-spending customers. Second, we seek to build on our strong position in commercial payments by evolving our card value propositions, further differentiating our corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions and designing innovative products and features, including financing, banking and payment solutions for our business customers. Third, we are focused on strengthening our global, integrated network by continuing to increase merchant acceptance, providing merchants with fraud protection services, marketing insights and connections to higher-spending Card Members and working with our network partners to offer expanded products and services. Finally, we want to continue to build on our unique global position, seeking ways to use our differentiated business model and global presence as we progress against our other strategic imperatives. We previously had as a strategic imperative to make American Express an essential part of our customers’ digital lives, which we believe has become embedded in our company and is inherent in the work we do in furtherance of our strategic imperatives.</li><li><strong>[1]</strong> We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues’ needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2022, 92 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work.

The reduction in net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable credit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year.</li><li><strong>[10]</strong> Revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers’ total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand.</li></ul></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Top-K</h3><ol class="hits"><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p9)</span><span class="hit-body"> We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues’ needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2022, 92 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work. Our 2022 annual company scorecard included talent retention, colleague engagement and diversity representation goals. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 53.7 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 18.7 percent, 17.9 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2022 U.S. EEO-1 submission. As of December 31, 2022, 52 percent of our Executive Committee were women or from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds (based on self-identified characteristics). We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and regardless of race and ethnicity in the United States. These reviews consider several factors known to affect compensation, including role, level, tenure, performance and geography. In the instances where a review has found inconsistencies, we have made adjustments. After making these adjustments, we believe we maintained 100 percent pay equity in 2022 for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States. 6 </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p29)</span><span class="hit-body"> New products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in- force, coverage and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, merchant acquirers, aggregators, processors or other merchant service providers, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p49)</span><span class="hit-body"> Card Member rewards expense increased, primarily driven by increases in Membership Rewards and cash back rewards expenses, collectively, of $2.0 billion, and cobrand rewards expense of $1.0 billion, both of which were primarily driven by higher billed business. The increase in Membership Rewards expense was also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Business development expense increased, primarily due to increased partner payments and client incentives, both of which were driven by higher network volumes. Card Member services expense increased, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits. Marketing expense increased, primarily due to business investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, reflecting an increase in our colleague base to support business growth as well as compensation decisions made. Other expenses increased, primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current year, as compared to net gains in the prior year. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p92)</span><span class="hit-body"> Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Express Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for credit losses on certain financial instruments in 2020. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p85)</span><span class="hit-body"> As previously disclosed, we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former U.S. Card Members with multiple cards were not credited certain Membership Rewards points that they had earned. We completed our review of this matter in the fourth quarter of 2022, which resulted in an immaterial impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2022. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p45)</span><span class="hit-body"> Our results for the year demonstrate that our growth strategy is working and our business is in an even stronger position today than before the pandemic. Spending on our network reached record levels, and credit metrics remain below pre-pandemic levels. Our investments in product innovation, technology, people and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with customers and expanded merchant acceptance. For 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago. The reduction in net income reflected credit reserve builds and net losses in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the current year compared with sizeable credit reserve releases and significant net gains in our Amex Ventures strategic investment portfolio in the prior year. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p6)</span><span class="hit-body"> We operate a payments network through which we establish and maintain relationships with third-party banks and other institutions in approximately 103 countries and territories, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of our global network. These network partners are licensed to issue local currency American Express-branded cards in their countries and/or serve as the merchant acquirer for local merchants on our network. For the year ended December 31, 2022, worldwide network services processed volume (spending on American Express cards issued by third parties) was $214.5 billion and at December 31, 2022, we had 56.5 million cards-in-force issued by third parties worldwide. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p117)</span><span class="hit-body"> Card Member receivables reserve for credit losses increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily driven by higher delinquencies and growth in receivables outstanding. Card Member receivables reserve for credit losses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic forecasts, in large part driven by improvement in unemployment rate projections, partially offset by an increase in receivables outstanding. The following table presents changes in the Card Member receivables reserve for credit losses for the years ended December 31: </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p8)</span><span class="hit-body"> We seek to grow our business by focusing on four strategic imperatives: First, we aim to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver membership benefits that span our customers’ everyday spending, borrowing, travel and lifestyle needs, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and developing a range of experiences that attract high-spending customers. Second, we seek to build on our strong position in commercial payments by evolving our card value propositions, further differentiating our corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions and designing innovative products and features, including financing, banking and payment solutions for our business customers. Third, we are focused on strengthening our global, integrated network by continuing to increase merchant acceptance, providing merchants with fraud protection services, marketing insights and connections to higher-spending Card Members and working with our network partners to offer expanded products and services. Finally, we want to continue to build on our unique global position, seeking ways to use our differentiated business model and global presence as we progress against our other strategic imperatives. We previously had as a strategic imperative to make American Express an essential part of our customers’ digital lives, which we believe has become embedded in our company and is inherent in the work we do in furtherance of our strategic imperatives. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p29)</span><span class="hit-body"> Revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers’ total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short-term incentives rather than incentivize long-term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand. </span></li></ol></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Yes, there is decline in number stores by 1.32% from 982 stores in Q2 FY 2023 to 969 by the end of Q2 FY2024.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The number of stores decreased by 20-30 in fiscal 2024, as stated in source [6]. However, the exact numbers from the tables in source [1] and [2] are unclear due to potential differences in segments or periods. Based on the text, the answer reflects the planned closure of 20-30 stores in fiscal 2024.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer gives an inaccurate figure (20–30 closures) and references a general fiscal period, contradicting the ground truth’s 13‑store decline in Q2 FY2024.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p16):</strong> iscal 2024 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines in appliances, home theater,

first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased 7.1% and 9.7% on a comparable basis, respectively. These decreases in revenue were primarily due to the reasons 
described above and within the Consolidated Results section, above.

We continue to appropriately balance the need to adjust in response to current industry sales trends with the need to invest so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to expected growth. Our digital sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and nearly twice as high as the percentage of Domestic revenue in the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020. During these same time periods, the percentage of online sales picked up in our stores by our customers was also consistent at just over 40%. Therefore, we are continuing to adapt our omni-channel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. We believe our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work.

This growth has been driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this profit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is expected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year. Our SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll expense. Our SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense. The reduction in restructuring charges in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024 was primarily related to higher-than-expected employee retention from our fiscal 2023 resource optimization initiative. Refer to Note 2, Restructuring, of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. Our operating income rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, due to an increase in gross profit rate and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by an unfavorable SG&A rate. Our operating income rate decreased in the six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to decreased leverage from lower sales volume on our fixed expenses and higher incentive compensation expense, which resulted in an unfavorable SG&A rate, partially offset by favorability in gross profit rate. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p2)</span><span class="hit-body"> Part I — Financial Information 3 Financial Statements 3 a) Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of July 29, 2023, January 28, 2023, and July 30, 2022 3 b) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023, and July 30, 2022 4 c) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023, and July 30, 2022 5 d) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the six months ended July 29, 2023, and July 30, 2022 6 e) Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders' Equity for the three and six months ended July 29, 2023, and July 30, 2022 7 f) Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 8 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 14 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 24 Controls and Procedures 24 Part II — Other Information 24 Legal Proceedings 24 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 25 Other Information 25 Exhibits 25 26 </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p14)</span><span class="hit-body"> We are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The provided sources do not explicitly report Boeing&#x27;s gross margin figures for FY2022. However, operating margin data from the 10-K filing shows a slight deterioration from FY2021 to FY2022, with GAAP operating margins decreasing from (4.7)% to (5.3)%. This suggests no improvement in operating performance, but the term &#x27;gross margin&#x27; is not directly addressed in the data.

One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods. 787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased the accounting quantity for the 787 program by 100 units due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program’s profit margin. We received FAA authorization to resume delivery on July 28, 2022 and deliveries resumed in August. During 2022, we delivered 31 aircraft to customers. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered aircraft. During 2021, we delivered 14 aircraft between March and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused in May 2021 due to production quality issues including in our supply chain. We have implemented changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had approximately 100 and 110 aircraft in inventory. Most of the aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2022 are expected to deliver by the end of 2024. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p51)</span><span class="hit-body"> To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined. The 767, 777X, and 787 programs had near break-even or single digit margins at December 31, 2022. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods. 777X Program The 777X program had near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2022. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p2)</span><span class="hit-body"> Legal Proceedings Item 3.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [novel-generated]</h3><div class="text">What drove the increase in Ulta Beauty&#x27;s merchandise inventories balance at end of FY2023?</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Increase in Merchandise inventories balance was driven by the opening of 47 new stores. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Ulta Beauty&#x27;s net income for the fiscal year ending January 28, 2023, was $1,242,408 thousand (up from $985,837 thousand in the prior year), with diluted EPS of $24.01 (compared to $17.98 in the prior year) [i]. Quarterly sales for the year-ago period were $2.7 billion, increasing to $3.2 billion in the most recent quarter [v]. However, discrepancies exist in the data: another source cites a net income of $340,751 thousand for the same fiscal year [vii], which conflicts with the $1.24 billion figure. This inconsistency may arise from differing time frames (quarterly vs. annual) or data errors.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer fails to mention the opening of 47 new stores, the correct driver of the inventory increase, and instead focuses on unrelated financial metrics.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p2):</strong> Balance Sheet
Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were $737.9
million.
Merchandise inventories, net at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $1.6
billion compared to $1.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The $104.2
million increase was primarily due to the opening of 47 new stores since January 29, 2022,

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Wages expense as a percent of net sales increased in FY2023. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Ulta Beauty&#x27;s wages expense as a percentage of net sales decreased in FY2023. The Selling, General and Administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses, which include wages, accounted for 23.6% of net sales in FY2023 compared to 23.8% in the prior year [1]. This represents a decrease of 0.2 percentage points [1].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer incorrectly states the wages expense decreased in FY2023, while the ground truth indicates it increased.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p1):</strong> For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022
Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&amp;A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to
23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of
incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate
overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits
due to wage investments.</div></div>

Our investments in product innovation, technology, people and our brand has led to increased generational relevance with Millennial and Gen Z customers, record new card acquisitions, deeper relationships with customers and expanded merchant acceptance. For 2022, we reported net income of $7.5 billion, or $9.85 per share, compared with net income of $8.1 billion, or $10.02 per share, a year ago.

Our 2022 annual company scorecard included talent retention, colleague engagement and diversity representation goals. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 53.7 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 18.7 percent, 17.9 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2022 U.S. EEO-1 submission. As of December 31, 2022, 52 percent of our Executive Committee were women or from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds (based on self-identified characteristics). We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and regardless of race and ethnicity in the United States. These reviews consider several factors known to affect compensation, including role, level, tenure, performance and geography. In the instances where a review has found inconsistencies, we have made adjustments. After making these adjustments, we believe we maintained 100 percent pay equity in 2022 for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States. 6</li><li><strong>[4]</strong> Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Express Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The increase in Membership Rewards expense was also driven by a larger proportion of spend in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel and a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. The Membership Rewards Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) for current program participants was 96 percent (rounded down) at both December 31, 2022 and 2021. Business development expense increased, primarily due to increased partner payments and client incentives, both of which were driven by higher network volumes. Card Member services expense increased, primarily due to higher usage of travel-related benefits. Marketing expense increased, primarily due to business investments to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased, primarily driven by higher compensation costs, reflecting an increase in our colleague base to support business growth as well as compensation decisions made. Other expenses increased, primarily driven by net losses on Amex Ventures investments in the current year, as compared to net gains in the prior year.</li><li><strong>[8]</strong> New products, such as debit cards on the American Express network, could fail to gain market acceptance and American Express cards could become less desirable to consumers and businesses generally due to surcharging, steering or other forms of discrimination, which could result in a decrease in cards-in- force, coverage and transaction volumes. The impact could vary depending on such factors as: the industry or manner in which a surcharge is levied; how Card Members are surcharged or steered to other card products or payment forms at the point of sale; the ease and speed of implementation for merchants, merchant acquirers, aggregators, processors or other merchant service providers, including as a result of new or emerging technologies; the size and recurrence of the underlying charges; and whether and to what extent these actions are applied to other forms of payment, including whether it varies depending on the type of card (e.g., credit or debit), product, network, acquirer or issuer. Discrimination against American Express cards could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business.</li><li><strong>[9]</strong> As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 77,300 people, whom we refer to as colleagues, with approximately 26,000 colleagues in the United States and approximately 51,300 colleagues outside the United States. We added colleagues in 2022 to support our strong business growth. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to offer a compelling value proposition to our colleagues, including competitive compensation and leading benefits. We continuously invest in programs, benefits and resources to foster the personal and professional growth of our colleagues. We provide learning opportunities in many forms, including tools and guidance for maximizing learning on the job; cross-border and cross-business unit assignments; career coaching, mentoring and professional networking; rotation opportunities; virtual learning sessions; and formal classroom instruction. The health and wellness of our colleagues continue to be priorities for us and we take a holistic approach to well-being, providing resources that address the physical, financial and mental health of our colleagues. Throughout 2022, we launched Amex Flex across our offices, where, depending on role and business needs, colleagues can work in the office, at home or take a hybrid approach that combines both. This approach is designed to enable us to both broaden the talent pool from which we can attract candidates and increase colleague retention.</li><li><strong>[10]</strong> We seek to grow our business by focusing on four strategic imperatives: First, we aim to expand our leadership in the premium consumer space by continuing to deliver membership benefits that span our customers’ everyday spending, borrowing, travel and lifestyle needs, expanding our roster of business partners around the globe and developing a range of experiences that attract high-spending customers. Second, we seek to build on our strong position in commercial payments by evolving our card value propositions, further differentiating our corporate card and accounts payable expense management solutions and designing innovative products and features, including financing, banking and payment solutions for our business customers. Third, we are focused on strengthening our global, integrated network by continuing to increase merchant acceptance, providing merchants with fraud protection services, marketing insights and connections to higher-spending Card Members and working with our network partners to offer expanded products and services. Finally, we want to continue to build on our unique global position, seeking ways to use our differentiated business model and global presence as we progress against our other strategic imperatives. We previously had as a strategic imperative to make American Express an essential part of our customers’ digital lives, which we believe has become embedded in our company and is inherent in the work we do in furtherance of our strategic imperatives.</li></ul></div>

During the year, we continued to make significant investments in marketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 24 percent year-over-year, primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with our Amex Ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year, as well as higher compensation costs due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made. We remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies, while continuing to invest in our growth strategy. During the year, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and dividend payments, while maintaining our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio within our target range of 10 to 11 percent. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while managing our CET1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting balance sheet growth. We also expect to increase the regular quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding by 15 percent beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration. Our performance continues to give us confidence in our business model and our strategy, and while we recognize the uncertainty of the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on delivering sustainable and profitable growth. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p9)</span><span class="hit-body"> We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues’ needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2022, 92 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work.

Spending on our cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our competitors, offers superior value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and larger transactions. Because of the revenues generated from having high-spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Customer deposits</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">American Express&#x27;s 2022 financials show a net income of $7,514 million, down from $8,060 million in 2021 [9]. However, net cash provided by operating activities increased significantly to $21,079 million in 2022 compared to $14,645 million in 2021, driven by higher accounts payable and other liabilities [9]. Investing activities used $33,689 million in 2022, primarily due to purchases of investments and loans, up from $10,529 million in 2021 [9]. Financing activities provided $24,509 million in 2022, reflecting debt issuances and share repurchases [9]. The company&#x27;s debt structure includes secured overnight financing rates (SOFR) and other metrics, with specific figures like 10.2, 1.0, 1.2, 0.8, 7.3, and 20.5 reported in 2022 [10].

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

On- and off-balance sheet items are weighted for risk, with off-balance sheet items converted to balance sheet equivalents, using risk conversion factors, before being allocated a risk-adjusted weight. Off-balance sheet exposures comprise a minimal part of the total risk-weighted assets. Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio — Calculated as CET1 capital, divided by risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital is common shareholders’ equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets. CET1 capital is also adjusted for the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) final rules, as described below. 62 </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p9)</span><span class="hit-body"> We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues’ needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2022, 92 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work. Our 2022 annual company scorecard included talent retention, colleague engagement and diversity representation goals. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 53.7 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 18.7 percent, 17.9 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2022 U.S. EEO-1 submission. As of December 31, 2022, 52 percent of our Executive Committee were women or from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds (based on self-identified characteristics). We regularly review our compensation practices to ensure colleagues in the same job, level and location are compensated fairly regardless of gender globally, and regardless of race and ethnicity in the United States. These reviews consider several factors known to affect compensation, including role, level, tenure, performance and geography. In the instances where a review has found inconsistencies, we have made adjustments. After making these adjustments, we believe we maintained 100 percent pay equity in 2022 for colleagues across genders globally and across races and ethnicities in the United States. 6 </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p252)</span><span class="hit-body"> Country Name Jurisdiction United States New York United States Arizona Russian Federation United States New York United States New York Accertify, Inc.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Boeing&#x27;s financial performance in 2022 showed a reduction in losses compared to 2021, with a net loss of $5,053 million versus $4,290 million in 2021, but still significantly higher than 2020&#x27;s $11,941 million loss [i]. Operating cash flow improved in 2022, with $3,512 million provided, compared to $18,410 million used in 2020, indicating better operational cash generation [i]. However, financing activities in 2022 used $1,266 million, contrasting with 2020&#x27;s $34,955 million inflow, suggesting reduced reliance on external financing [i].

The weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation of the August 2023 Guidance for Adjusted Diluted EPS reflects the net reduction of approximately 73.5 million shares of Johnson & Johnson outstanding common stock as a result of the Kenvue exchange offer. Because this net reduction occurred on August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson will recognize only a partial-year benefit of $0.28 to its full-year 2023 Adjusted Diluted EPS. The Company generated $13.2 billion in cash proceeds as result of the Kenvue debt offering and initial public offering. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson maintains a 9.5% stake in Kenvue common stock, which provides the Company the opportunity to monetize the retained stake in a tax efficient manner in the next year, subject to a current 90-day lockup agreement. Johnson & Johnson is under no obligation to do so if market conditions are not supportive.
