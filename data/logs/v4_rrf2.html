<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [novel-generated]</h3><div class="text">What was the key agenda of the AMCOR&#x27;s 8k filing dated 1st July 2022?</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Amcor Finance (USA), Inc. and Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc., entered into supplemental indentures relating to Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2026 and 2028. This involved the substitution of the Substitute Issuer (Amcor Flexibles North America) for the Former Issuer (Amcor Finance) and the assumption of covenants under the indentures. (In essence a novation agreement)</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The key agenda of AMCOR&#x27;s 8K filing dated 1st July 2022 was the execution of the First and Second Supplemental Indentures on June 30, 2022, which facilitated the substitution of Amcor Flexibles North America, Inc. (the Substitute Issuer) for Amcor Finance (USA), Inc. (the Former Issuer) as the issuer of the Existing Notes and New Notes. This involved the assumption by the Substitute Issuer of the covenants under the 2016 Indenture and 2019 Indenture governing the 3.625% Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2026 and 4.500% Guaranteed Senior Notes due 2028 [1].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer accurately states that the filing involved supplemental indentures for the 2026 and 2028 notes, the substitution of Amcor Flexibles North America for Amcor Finance, and the assumption of covenants—exactly matching the ground‑truth information.</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [domain-relevant]</h3><div class="text">Does AMEX have an improving operating margin profile as of 2022? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Performance is not measured through operating margin</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The provided sources do not include explicit operating margin figures for AMEX in 2022 or prior periods, making it impossible to determine if there is an improving operating margin profile. Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by revenue, but none of the sources provide operating income or revenue data for comparative analysis [1, 2, 3]. Additionally, factors like net losses from Amex Ventures and increased expenses are discussed, but these affect net income rather than directly reflecting operating margin trends [1, 2]. Since the necessary financial metrics for operating margin are not available, it is not possible to assess the metric&#x27;s utility or trend for AMEX in 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer correctly states that operating margin is not a measured performance metric for AMEX and notes the lack of data, aligning with the ground truth that performance is not measured through operating margin.</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [domain-relevant]</h3><div class="text">What drove gross margin change as of the FY2022 for American Express? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Performance is not measured through gross margin</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Gross margin is not a useful metric for American Express, as the company operates primarily as a financial services firm with revenue derived from fees and transaction-based charges, rather than product sales subject to cost of goods sold (COGS). Instead, factors like credit reserve builds and losses in strategic investment portfolios (e.g., Amex Ventures) directly impact profitability. For FY2022, net income declined due to credit reserve builds and net losses in Amex Ventures, compared to prior-year credit reserve releases and gains [6]. These operational and investment-related factors are more relevant than gross margin for assessing performance.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer correctly states that gross margin is not a useful metric for American Express and provides a valid explanation consistent with the ground truth that performance is not measured through gross margin.</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [novel-generated]</h3><div class="text">Is Boeing&#x27;s business subject to cyclicality?</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Yes, Boeing&#x27;s business is subject to cyclicality due to its exposure to the airline industry which is a cyclical industry.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Boeing&#x27;s business is subject to cyclicality, particularly in its Commercial Airplanes segment, which is influenced by economic conditions and market demand. However, segments like Defense, Space &amp; Security (BDS) and Global Services (BGS) are less cyclical due to government contracts and long-term commitments. The company&#x27;s overall performance is mixed, with cyclical factors affecting revenue and profitability, as seen in the Commercial Airplanes segment&#x27;s historical earnings volatility [3]. Additionally, the reliance on U.S. government contracts (40% of 2022 revenues) introduces some stability but also sensitivity to fiscal policy and economic cycles [10].</div></div>

The first production and support contract option is expected to be exercised in 2024. We increased the estimated reach forward loss by $552 during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by ongoing supply chain negotiations (which are impacted by supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures), and design revisions, as well as an increase in the number of expected units in the initial production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [novel-generated]</h3><div class="text">What drove the reduction in SG&amp;A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023?</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The reduction in SG&amp;A expense as a percent of net sales in FY2023 was driven by lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales, which partially offset deleverage from corporate overhead and store payroll and benefits due to wage investments [i]. This aligns with trends observed in FY2022, where similar factors contributed to a decrease in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales [i].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer accurately states the same drivers—lower marketing expenses and incentive compensation leverage due to higher sales—and adds no contradictory information.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p1):</strong> For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022
Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&amp;A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to
23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of
incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate
overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits
due to wage investments.</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Top-K</h3><ol class="hits"><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p37)</span><span class="hit-body"> New tax legislation could be enacted in the countries in which we have operations. For example, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) would impact how multinational enterprises (MNEs) are taxed on their global profits. In particular, the OECD’s guidelines on a global minimum tax of 15 percent could impact the effective tax rate for many MNEs. A number of countries, including the Member States in the EU, have adopted, or plan to adopt, these minimum tax guidelines starting in 2024, which we expect would impact our effective tax rate when the rules become effective. In addition to legislative changes, actions by tax authorities, including an increase in tax audit activity, could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p150)</span><span class="hit-body"> | (Millions, except percentages) December 31, 2022: | CET 1 capital |  | Tier 1 capital | Total capital | | | CET \| capital ratio | Tier \| capital | ratio | Total capital ratio | Tier 1 levera ral | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | | American Express Company | 20,030 | $ | 21,627 | $ |  | 24,926 | 10\.3 % | 11\.1% |  | 12\.8% | 9\.9 | | American Express National Bank | 14820 | $ | 14820 | $ |  | 17,273 | 11\.3% | 11\.3 | % | 13\.2 % | 9\.7 | | December 31, 2021: | | | | | | | | | | | | | American Express Company | 17,554 | $ | 19,186 | $ |  | 21,506 | 10\.5 % | 11\.5 | % | 12\.9 % | 10\.5 | | American Express National Bank | 13,085 | $ | 13,085 | $ |  | 15,283 | 11\.8 % | 11\.8 | % | 13\.7 % | 10\.5 | | Well\-capitalized ratios © | | | | | | | | | | | | | American Express Company |  |  |  |  |  |  | N/A | 6\.0 | % | 10\.0 % |  | | American Express National Bank |  |  |  |  |  |  | 6\.5 % | 8\.0 | % | 10\.0 % | 5\.0 | | Minimum capital ratios © |  |  |  |  |  |  | 45% | 6\.0 | % | 8\.0 % | 4\.0 | | Effective Minimum | | | | | | | | | | | | | American Express Company |  |  |  |  |  |  | 7\.0 % | 8\.5 | % | 10\.5 % | 4\.0 | | American Express National Bank |  |  |  |  |  |  | 7\.0 % | 8\.5 | % | 10\.5 % | 4\.0 | </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p1)</span><span class="hit-body"> f ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 OR O TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 For the transition period from to Commission File No. 1 7657 AMERICAN) EXPRESS </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p92)</span><span class="hit-body"> We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of American Express Company and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders’ equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The sources do not provide the number of Best Buy stores at the end of Q2 FY2023, making it impossible to calculate the change between Q2 FY2024 and FY2023.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer gives wrong store numbers and claims a missing FY2023 figure, contradicting the ground truth that lists 982 stores in Q2 FY2023 and 969 in Q2 FY2024.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p16):</strong> iscal 2024 was primarily driven by comparable sales declines in appliances, home theater, 
computing and mobile phones, partially offset by comparable sales growth in gaming. Online revenue of $2.8 billion and $5.5 billion in the second quarter and 
first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased 7.1% and 9.7% on a comparable basis, respectively. These decreases in revenue were primarily due to the reasons 
described above and within the Consolidated Results section, above.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Boeing did not report any materially important ongoing legal battles in FY2022. The only legal matter mentioned relates to the Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Department of Justice, which involved payments of $1.0 billion in 2022 and $2.5 billion in 2021. This agreement appears to be a settled matter, as the financial statements focus on its resolution rather than ongoing litigation [1]. Other sources mention trade relations and intellectual property but do not indicate active legal battles [2, 7].</div></div>

Growth in Accounts Payable in 2022 is a source of cash while reductions in Accounts Payable in 2021 were a use of cash generally reflecting increases in production rates. Inventory improvements were driven by higher 737 MAX deliveries and resumption of 787 deliveries in 2022. Additionally, in 2022 and 2021 we received income tax refunds of $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.1 billion in 2022, as compared with $2.5 billion of cash provided in 2021. The $3.4 billion reduction in non cash items in 2022 is primarily driven by the $3.5 billion reach forward loss on the 787 program that was recorded in 2021. Net loss for 2022 was $5.1 billion compared with net loss of $4.3 billion in 2021.

Boeing has long standing relationships with our Chinese customers, who represent a key component of our commercial aircraft backlog. Overall, the U.S. China trade relationship remains stalled as economic and national security concerns continue to be a challenge.</li><li><strong>[7]</strong> We own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. Unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.</li></ul></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [domain-relevant]</h3><div class="text">Does Boeing have an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022? If gross margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then state that and explain why.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Boeing&#x27;s gross margin profile for FY2022 is not clearly improving, as the sources do not provide company-wide gross margin figures. However, the 777X program had near break-even gross margins in 2022 [1]. For the entire company, operating margins were -5.3% in FY2022, which is slightly worse than FY2021&#x27;s -4.7% but better than FY2020&#x27;s -22.0% [2]. Gross margin may not be a reliable metric for Boeing due to complexities in program accounting, where estimates of gross profit margins are subject to changes and recognized prospectively, leading to volatility [5].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer incorrectly states that Boeing’s gross margin profile is not clearly improving, contradicting the ground truth that shows a rise from 4.8% to 5.3% and a higher gross profit in FY2022.</div></div>

Growth in Accounts Payable in 2022 is a source of cash while reductions in Accounts Payable in 2021 were a use of cash generally reflecting increases in production rates.

Net loss for 2022 was $5.1 billion compared with net loss of $4.3 billion in 2021. The $0.8 billion year over year increase in the net loss is primarily driven by the absence of an income tax benefit in 2022. </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[table] (p55)</span><span class="hit-body"> | Years ended December 31, | 2022 | 2021 | 202( | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Sales of products | $55,893 | $51,386 | $47,142 | | Sales of services | 10,715 | 10,900 | 11,016 | | Total revenues | 66,608 | 62,286 | 58,158 | | Sost of products | (53,969\) | (49,954\) | (54,568 | | Dost of services | (9,109\) | (9,283\) | (9,232 | | 30eing Capital interest expense | (28\) | (32\) | (43 | | Total costs and expenses | (63,106\) | (59,269\) | (63,843 | |  | 3,502 | 3,017 | (5,685 | | Loss)/income from operating investments, net | (16\) | 210 | 9 | | 3eneral and administrative expense | (4,187\) | (4,157\) | (4,817 | | Research and development expense, net | (2,852\) | (2,249\) | (2,476 | | Sain on dispositions, net | 6 | 277 | 202 | | \_oss from operations | (3,547\) | (2,902\) | (12,767 | | Dither income, net | 1,058 | 551 | 447 | | nterest and debt expense | (2,533\) | (2,682\) | (2,156 | | \_oss before income taxes | (5,022\) | (5,033\) | (14,476 | | ncome tax (expense)/benefit | (31\) | 743 | 2,535 | | Net loss | (5,053\) | (4,290\) | (11,941 | | \_ess: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest | (118\) | (88\) | (68 | | Net loss attributable to Boeing Shareholders | ($4,935\) | ($4,202\) | ($11,873 | | 3asic loss per share | ($8\.30\) | ($7\.15\) | ($20\.88 | | Diluted loss per share | ($8\.30\) | ($7\.15\) | ($20\.88 | </span></li><li><span class="hit-num">[text] (p119)</span><span class="hit-body"> We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements").

2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new
technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and
information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our
manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth
quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within
the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash
expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and
other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35%
for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Increase in Merchandise inventories balance was driven by the opening of 47 new stores.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The sources do not provide specific information about the drivers of the increase in Ulta Beauty&#x27;s merchandise inventories at the end of FY2023. However, for the end of FY2022 (Q4 2022), the increase was primarily attributed to the opening of 47 new stores since January 29, 2022, inventory to support new brand launches and brand expansions, and inventory cost increases [1].</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [novel-generated]</h3><div class="text">Did Ulta Beauty&#x27;s wages expense as a percent of net sales increase or decrease in FY2023?</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Wages expense as a percent of net sales increased in FY2023. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">Ulta Beauty&#x27;s wages expense as a percent of net sales decreased in FY2023 compared to FY2022. Selling, general, and administrative expenses (which include wages) as a percentage of net sales dropped from 23.8% in FY2022 to 23.6% in FY2023 [2].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer states wages expense fell as a percent of net sales, directly contradicting the ground truth that it increased in FY2023.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p1):</strong> For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022
Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&amp;A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to
23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of
incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate
overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits
due to wage investments.</div></div>

For additional information regarding the nature of charges discussed below, refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, Note 2, Restructuring, and Note 3, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Notes to 
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
(1)
Represents the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology assets.
(2)
Represents charges related to employee termination benefits and subsequent adjustments from higher-than-expected employee retention related to previously planned organizational changes.
(3)
Represents the gain on sale of a Mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in Mexico.
(4)
The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S. and Mexico. As such, the forecasted annual income tax charge on the U.S. non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 
24.5%. There is no forecasted annual income tax benefit for Mexico non-GAAP items, as there is no forecasted annual tax expense on the income in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.
 
Our non-GAAP operating income rates decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to unfavorable SG&amp;A rates, partially 
offset by favorable gross profit rates.
 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Our non-
GAAP effective tax rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax 
benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.
 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the decreases in non-GAAP operating income.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support 
our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital 
management. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share 
repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other 
changes in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.
