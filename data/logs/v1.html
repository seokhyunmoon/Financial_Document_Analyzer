<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Performance is not measured through operating margin</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The provided sources do not include the necessary financial data (operating income and revenue figures) to calculate or assess AMEX&#x27;s operating margin for 2022. While operating expenses increased by 24% year over year [8], revenue growth is not explicitly stated, making it impossible to determine if the operating margin improved. Additionally, the sources do not directly address whether operating margin is a useful metric for AMEX, though the spend-centric business model may complicate its relevance due to variable expense structures [5].</div></div>

Card Member rewards expense growth was also driven by a larger proportion of billed business in categories that earn incremental rewards such as travel. During the year, we continued to make significant investments in marketing to drive growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Operating expenses increased 24 percent year over year, primarily driven by net losses in the current year associated with our Amex Ventures equity investments as compared to net gains in the prior year, as well as higher compensation costs due to an increase in our colleague base to support business growth and compensation decisions we made. We remain focused on driving marketing and operating expense efficiencies, while continuing to invest in our growth strategy. During the year, we returned $4.9 billion of capital to our shareholders through common share repurchases and dividend payments, while maintaining our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio within our target range of 10 to 11 percent. We plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate, while managing our CET1 capital ratio within our target range and supporting balance sheet growth. We also expect to increase the regular quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding by 15 percent beginning with the first quarter 2023 dividend declaration.

Because of the revenues generated from having high spending Card Members and the annual card fees we charge on many of our products, we are able to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits for Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants.

We added colleagues in 2022 to support our strong business growth. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to offer a compelling value proposition to our colleagues, including competitive compensation and leading benefits. We continuously invest in programs, benefits and resources to foster the personal and professional growth of our colleagues. We provide learning opportunities in many forms, including tools and guidance for maximizing learning on the job; cross border and cross business unit assignments; career coaching, mentoring and professional networking; rotation opportunities; virtual learning sessions; and formal classroom instruction. The health and wellness of our colleagues continue to be priorities for us and we take a holistic approach to well being, providing resources that address the physical, financial and mental health of our colleagues. Throughout 2022, we launched Amex Flex across our offices, where, depending on role and business needs, colleagues can work in the office, at home or take a hybrid approach that combines both. This approach is designed to enable us to both broaden the talent pool from which we can attract candidates and increase colleague retention. We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues’ needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2022, 92 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work. Our 2022 annual company scorecard included talent retention, colleague engagement and diversity representation goals. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 53.7 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 18.7 percent, 17.9 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2022 U.S. EEO 1 submission. As of December 31, 2022, 52 percent of our Executive Committee were women or from diverse races and ethnic backgrounds (based on self identified characteristics). </span></li></ol></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Performance is not measured through gross margin</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The provided sources do not explicitly discuss changes in gross margin for American Express in FY2022 [i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi, vii, viii, ix, x]. Gross margin is not a primary metric emphasized in the company’s financial reporting or business model description, which focuses on revenue generation through spending on cards, fees, and credit loss provisions rather than traditional retail margin dynamics [i, iv, vii].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">Model answer correctly states that gross margin is not a primary metric for American Express and aligns with the ground truth that performance is not measured through gross margin.</div></div>

Our gross profit rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to improved financial performance from our membership offerings, which included higher services margin rates and reduced costs associated with program changes made to our free membership offering, favorable product margin rates, the profit sharing revenue from our private label and co branded credit card arrangement and an improved gross profit rate from our Health initiatives. Our profit sharing revenue from our credit card arrangement has been a consistent benefit to our gross profit and operating income rates for the past nine quarters and approximated 1.4% of Domestic revenue in fiscal 2023, an increase of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2020. This growth has been driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment.

We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes. We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S. and our Best Buy Health business. The International segment is comprised of all our operations in Canada. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. Comparable Sales Throughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. Comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations, the impact of profit share revenue from our services plan portfolio and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (applicable to our International segment only). All periods presented apply this methodology consistently. </span></li></ol></div>

The 787 program is expected to gradually increase production rates to 5 aircraft per month in 2023. The 777X program, which was paused, is planned to resume production in 2023.

A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane deliveries based on delivery delays.

Operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in additional production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out of sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID 19, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain as we ramp up production.

The enacted FY23 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, including the F/A 18 Super Hornet, F 15EX, CH 47 Chinook, AH 64 Apache, V 22 Osprey, KC 46A Tanker, MQ 25, and the Space Launch System. The FY23 appropriations support F/A 18 production further into calendar year 2025. The FY23 appropriations did not include funding for additional P 8 aircraft. The P 8 program continues to pursue additional sales opportunities to extend production beyond 2024. There is ongoing uncertainty with respect to program level appropriations for the U.S. DoD, NASA and other government agencies for fiscal year 2024 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to continue to be subject to pressure. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows. Non U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The reduction in SG&amp;A expense as a percentage of net sales in FY2023 was primarily driven by lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales. These factors offset partial deleverage from corporate overhead and store payroll/benefits related to strategic investments and wage investments [1]. This resulted in SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales decreasing to 23.5% compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2021 [10].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model correctly identifies lower marketing expenses and leverage of incentive compensation as the drivers, matching the ground truth, and adds no contradictory information.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p1):</strong> For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022
Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&amp;A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to

For additional information regarding the nature of charges discussed below, refer to Note 1, Basis of Presentation, Note 2, Restructuring, and Note 3, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, of the Notes to 
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
(1)
Represents the non-cash amortization of definite-lived intangible assets associated with acquisitions, including customer relationships, tradenames and developed technology assets.
(2)
Represents charges related to employee termination benefits and subsequent adjustments from higher-than-expected employee retention related to previously planned organizational changes.
(3)
Represents the gain on sale of a Mexico subsidiary subsequent to our exit from operations in Mexico.
(4)
The non-GAAP adjustments primarily relate to the U.S. and Mexico. As such, the forecasted annual income tax charge on the U.S. non-GAAP adjustments is calculated using the statutory tax rate of 
24.5%. There is no forecasted annual income tax benefit for Mexico non-GAAP items, as there is no forecasted annual tax expense on the income in the calculation of GAAP income tax expense.
 
Our non-GAAP operating income rates decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to unfavorable SG&amp;A rates, partially 
offset by favorable gross profit rates.
 
Our non-GAAP effective tax rate increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters. Our non-
GAAP effective tax rate increased in the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the prior year resolution of certain discrete tax matters and decreased tax 
benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower pre-tax earnings.
 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS decreased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the decreases in non-GAAP operating income.
 
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
We closely manage our liquidity and capital resources. Our liquidity requirements depend on key variables, including the level of investment required to support 
our business strategies, the performance of our business, capital expenditures, dividends, credit facilities, short-term borrowing arrangements and working capital 
management. We modify our approach to managing these variables as changes in our operating environment arise. For example, capital expenditures and share 
repurchases are a component of our cash flow and capital management strategy, which, to a large extent, we can adjust in response to economic and other 
changes in our business environment. We have a disciplined approach to capital allocation, which focuses on investing in key priorities that support our strategy.

All adjustments were comprised of normal recurring adjustments, except as noted in these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire fiscal year. The interim financial statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2023. The first six months of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 included 26 weeks. In preparing the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, we evaluated the period from July 29, 2023, through the date the financial statements were issued for material subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure.

Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2022 04 (“ASU 2022 04”), Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405 50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. ASU 2022 04 requires entities to disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs they use in connection with the purchase of goods and services, along with the amount of obligations outstanding at the end of each period and an annual roll forward of such obligations.

We continue to appropriately balance the need to adjust in response to current industry sales trends with the need to invest so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to expected growth. Our digital sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and nearly twice as high as the percentage of Domestic revenue in the pre pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020. During these same time periods, the percentage of online sales picked up in our stores by our customers was also consistent at just over 40%. Therefore, we are continuing to adapt our omni channel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape. We believe our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver our fiscal 2024 store plans, which include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 large format Experience store remodels and expanding the number of Outlet stores to approximately 25 by the end of fiscal 2024. We continue to advance our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our industry and marketplace trends with two overarching goals in mind efficiently allocating our labor cost, considering the channel shift from our physical stores to online, and providing our employees flexibility, predictability and opportunities to gain more skills. We are focused on balancing the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our customers and other stakeholders.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Yes. Boeing has an improving gross margin profile as of FY2022. Gross profit improved from $3,017 million in FY2021 to $3,502 million in FY2022. Gross margin % improved from 4.8% in FY2021 to 5.3% in FY2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The provided sources do not include gross margin data for Boeing in FY2022. The available information references operating margins and core operating margins, which are both negative and slightly worse in 2022 compared to 2021 [1]. Gross margin is not explicitly reported in the consolidated financial statements or notes [3, 4, 5]. While operating margins indicate declining profitability, gross margin would require separate data on gross profit, which is not provided. For a company like Boeing with complex operations and segment-specific costs, gross margin may not capture the full financial picture, but this is speculative without explicit metric guidance from the sources.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model incorrectly states gross‑margin data is unavailable and cannot confirm improvement, whereas the ground truth provides specific figures showing a higher gross margin in FY2022.</div></div>

2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new
technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and
information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our
manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth
quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within
the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash
expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and
other employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35%
for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p1):</strong> For the Full Year of Fiscal 2022
Net sales increased 18.3% to $10.2 billion compared to $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021,
primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty
category, retail price increases, the impact of new brands and product innovation,
increased social occasions, and fewer COVID-19 limitations compared to fiscal 2021.
Comparable sales increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 37.9% in fiscal 2021,
driven by a 10.8% increase in transactions and a 4.3% increase in average ticket.
Gross profit increased 20.1% to $4.0 billion compared to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2021. As
a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 39.6% compared to 39.0% in fiscal
2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, strong growth in other revenue, and
favorable channel mix shifts, partially offset by higher inventory shrink and lower
merchandise margin.
SG&amp;A expenses increased 16.2% to $2.4 billion compared to $2.1 billion in fiscal
2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A expenses decreased to 23.5% compared to
23.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower marketing expenses and leverage of
incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of corporate
overhead due to strategic investments and deleverage of store payroll and benefits
due to wage investments.</div></div>

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Question [novel-generated]</h3><div class="text">Was American Express able to retain card members during 2022?</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Yes</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">American Express reported having 76.7 million proprietary cards in force worldwide as of December 31, 2022 [1], which suggests they maintained their card member base during the year. However, the sources do not explicitly state retention rates or attrition metrics, nor do they confirm whether the number of card members increased, decreased, or remained stable compared to prior periods. The company did mention retaining existing card members as part of its growth initiatives [6], but this is a strategic goal rather than a confirmed outcome.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer hints at retention but does not explicitly confirm it, leaving the answer incomplete compared to the straightforward &quot;Yes&quot; of the ground truth.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Evidence (dataset)</h3><div class="text"><strong>Evidence 1 (p44):</strong> Net card fees increased 17 percent year over-year, as new card acquisitions reached record levels in 2022 and Card Member
retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Citations</h3><ul class="citations"><li><strong>[1]</strong> For the year ended December 31, 2022, worldwide billed business (spending on American Express cards issued by us) was $1,338 billion and at December 31, 2022, we had 76.7 million proprietary cards in force worldwide.</li><li><strong>[6]</strong> Revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our cards, growing loan balances and increasing fee revenue. We have been investing in a number of growth initiatives, including to attract new Card Members, retain existing Card Members and capture a greater share of customers’ total spending and borrowings. There can be no assurance that our investments will continue to be effective, particularly as consumer and business behaviors continue to change. In addition, if we develop new products or offers that attract customers looking for short term incentives rather than incentivize long term loyalty, Card Member attrition and costs could increase. Increasing spending on our cards also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our cards. If we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perceptions of coverage or merchants decide to no longer accept American Express cards, our business could suffer. Expanding our service offerings, adding customer acquisition channels and forming new partnerships or renewing current partnerships could have higher costs than our current arrangements, fail to resonate with customers, adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand. Another way we invest in customer value is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Card Member benefits. Any significant change in, or failure by management to reasonably estimate, actual redemptions of Membership Rewards points and associated redemption costs could adversely affect our profitability. We rely on third parties for certain redemption options and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption options in the future, which could diminish the value of the program for our Card Members. Our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. In addition, many credit card issuers have instituted rewards and cobrand programs and may introduce programs and services that are similar to or more attractive than ours. Our inability to differentiate our products and services could materially adversely affect us.</li></ul></div>

We added colleagues in 2022 to support our strong business growth. To attract and retain the best talent, we strive to offer a compelling value proposition to our colleagues, including competitive compensation and leading benefits. We continuously invest in programs, benefits and resources to foster the personal and professional growth of our colleagues. We provide learning opportunities in many forms, including tools and guidance for maximizing learning on the job; cross border and cross business unit assignments; career coaching, mentoring and professional networking; rotation opportunities; virtual learning sessions; and formal classroom instruction. The health and wellness of our colleagues continue to be priorities for us and we take a holistic approach to well being, providing resources that address the physical, financial and mental health of our colleagues. Throughout 2022, we launched Amex Flex across our offices, where, depending on role and business needs, colleagues can work in the office, at home or take a hybrid approach that combines both. This approach is designed to enable us to both broaden the talent pool from which we can attract candidates and increase colleague retention. We conduct an annual Colleague Experience Survey to better understand our colleagues’ needs and overall experience at American Express and in 2022, 92 percent of colleagues who participated in the survey said they would recommend American Express as a great place to work. Our 2022 annual company scorecard included talent retention, colleague engagement and diversity representation goals. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 53.7 percent of our global workforce and Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people represented 18.7 percent, 17.9 percent and 14.2 percent, respectively, of our U.S. workforce based on preliminary data for our 2022 U.S. EEO 1 submission.

However, the commercial aviation segment, a major part of Boeing&#x27;s operations, is inherently tied to economic cycles due to demand fluctuations from airline industries and global economic conditions.

<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Ground Truth</h3><div class="text">Increase in Merchandise inventories balance was driven by the opening of 47 new stores. The answer here assumes FY2023 refers to the 12 months ended on January 28, 2023 (although the company refers to this period as its fiscal 2022.</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Generated Answer</h3><div class="text">The increase in Ulta Beauty&#x27;s merchandise inventories balance at the end of FY2023 was driven by robust demand, expanded store operations, and strategic inventory management to support growth. Record sales and heightened consumer demand, as highlighted in the CEO&#x27;s remarks [7], necessitated higher inventory levels to meet customer needs. Additionally, store expansions and operational updates [2] likely contributed to increased inventory requirements. These factors align with the company&#x27;s focus on capturing market share and sustaining profitability [7].</div></div>
<div class="block"><h3 class="label">Eval Reasoning</h3><div class="text">The model answer cites demand and store expansion generally but omits the specific driver of 47 new store openings that the ground truth identifies.</div></div>

Merchandise inventories, net at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 totaled $1.6
billion compared to $1.5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The $104.2
