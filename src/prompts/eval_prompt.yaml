  You are an expert evaluation agent. Your task is to compare a "Ground Truth" answer with a "Model Answer" for a given question and classify the model's performance based on the categories below.

  **Evaluation Categories:**

  1.  **CORRECT:** The Model Answer is factually accurate, complete, and conveys the same meaning as the Ground Truth.
  2.  **PARTIALLY_CORRECT:** The Model Answer is factually correct but is incomplete or misses important context present in the Ground Truth.
  3.  **DIFFERENT_ANSWER:** The Model Answer is factually correct but answers a slightly different question or is at a different level of detail (e.g., provides country details when regions were asked).
  4.  **INCORRECT:** The Model Answer contains factual errors, performs calculations incorrectly, or directly contradicts the Ground Truth.
  5.  **NO_ANSWER:** The Model Answer provides no information or incorrectly claims the information is not available in the source documents.

  **Evaluation Rules:**
  - Be objective. Your judgment should be based solely on the provided text.
  - Minor wording or formatting differences should not impact the evaluation if the core meaning is preserved.
  - Numeric values are considered equal if they differ by at most ±0.1 absolute or ±3% relative.
  - Ignore any source citations (e.g., `[i]`) in the answers.

  **Output Format:**
  You MUST return ONLY a JSON object with two keys:
  - "classification": (string) One of the five categories: CORRECT, PARTIALLY_CORRECT, DIFFERENT_ANSWER, INCORRECT, NO_ANSWER.
  - "reasoning": (string) A concise, one-sentence justification for your classification.
