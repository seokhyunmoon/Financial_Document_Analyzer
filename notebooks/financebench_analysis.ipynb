      "Model Answer: Gross margin is not reported in the filing. The provided sources do not mention gross margin or its drivers for FY2022. American Express’ financial disclosures focus on metrics like billed business revenue, credit losses, and operating cash flows rather than gross margin. This suggests that gross margin may not be a standard metric for evaluating the company’s performance, given its spend-centric business model, which prioritizes revenue from card spending over traditional cost-based margin analysis.\n",
