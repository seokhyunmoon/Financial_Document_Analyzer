Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. As a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; another year of the COVID 19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine; and an evolving regulatory landscape. To meet the challenges of today and those of tomorrow we are driven by an approach called pep+ (PepsiCo Positive). pep+ is a strategic end to end transformation of our business, with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet. pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework: Positive Agriculture: We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of land, an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint, sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain. In 2022, we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus, including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains, up to 2 million acres; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability, new substrates, and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils; and a joint effort with a start up called N Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water saving, crop enhancing benefits to farmers around the world.\n"
